# Authentication System Guide

## Fixed Issues

The authentication system has been updated to work properly with a mock backend service since there's no actual backend server running.

## Demo Credentials

### Admin Access
- **Email**: admin@yatraelevators.com
- **Password**: admin123
- **Role**: admin
- **Access**: Full admin panel access

### Regular User Access
- **Email**: user@example.com
- **Password**: user123
- **Role**: user
- **Access**: Basic user features

## Features Working

✅ **Login/Logout**: Both admin and user accounts
✅ **Registration**: Create new accounts
✅ **Profile Management**: Update user profile information
✅ **Password Change**: Change user passwords
✅ **Role-based Access**: Different access levels for admin/user
✅ **Session Persistence**: Stays logged in after page refresh
✅ **Form Validation**: Email, password strength validation
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for invalid credentials

## How to Test

1. **Login Testing**:
   - Go to `/auth`
   - Use the demo credentials above
   - Should redirect to `/admin` for admin users
   - Should redirect to `/profile` for regular users

2. **Registration Testing**:
   - Click "Sign Up" on the auth page
   - Fill in new user details
   - Creates new account and logs in automatically

3. **Admin Panel Access**:
   - Login with admin credentials
   - Access `/admin` route
   - Full admin functionality available

4. **Profile Management**:
   - Login with any account
   - Go to `/profile`
   - Update user information
   - Changes persist across sessions

## Technical Details

- **Mock Service**: Uses localStorage for data persistence
- **Token System**: JWT-like token simulation
- **Auto-redirect**: Handles navigation based on auth state
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling
- **Development Mode**: Automatically uses mock service in development

## Backend Integration

When ready to connect to a real backend:

1. Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable
2. The system will automatically switch from mock to real API
3. All existing code will work with minimal changes
4. Just ensure backend API matches the expected endpoints

## Security Notes

- Passwords are stored in plain text in mock service (development only)
- Real implementation should use proper password hashing
- JWT tokens should be properly signed and validated
- HTTPS should be used in production
